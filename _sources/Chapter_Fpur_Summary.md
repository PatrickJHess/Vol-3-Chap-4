## **Summarizing The Bootstrapping Results**

This chapter detailed the calculation of the term structure using coupon bonds. Our estimation utilized 304 bonds with maturities ranging from a few days up to five years. This sample allowed us to determine 149 unique payment dates, for each we calculated a zero price, as well as the corresponding spot and forward rates.

The subsequent chapter will apply this term structure to introduce par yields. A bond's par yield, which is dependent upon the prevailing term structure of interest rates, represents the coupon rate required for the bond to trade at its par value.
